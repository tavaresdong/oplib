# oplib
oplib is a collection of Algorithms and Datastructures, Some of are in
stl-style, others are not, the code uses modern c++ features.

# goal1
- All basic containers: vector list deque map set unordered(map and set)
- some additional data structures: AC automaton, all kinds of trees, graph
- All kinds of algorithms related to the data structures
- C++ standard library components, e.g smart pointers 
- future plan: Network related components

# TODO list
- add empty-base optimization to the containers with stateless allocators
- add move semantics related operations to the containers
